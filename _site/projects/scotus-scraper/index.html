  <p><a href="https://github.com/nikhilgahlawat/scotus_scraper/tree/main">SCOTUS Scraper</a> is a project to collect US Supreme Court opinions, briefs, and other documents filed with the Court and make them available in machine-readable format.</p>

<hr />

<p>A few weeks ago I was reading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/24/us/supreme-court-abortion-briefs.html">an article</a> about new research that takes an NLP-like approach to understanding how arguments are presented before the Supreme Court. The researchers collected amicus briefs filed in cases having to do with the same topic - in this case, reproductive rights - and analyzed their text to see how the arguments changed over time, and what that might indicate about how rhetorical strategies have evolved.</p>

<p>In short, they found that opponents to abortion had done a better job of adapting their strategies over time, making efforts to match the way the Court itself was changing, and made more emotional appeals.</p>

<p>I was curiuos to dig a bit deeper into the analysis. See what methods they used and if they could be applied to other issues commonly brought before the Court.</p>

<p>But when I looked through the <a href="https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4664&amp;context=mlr">full paper</a> I saw that they’d limited their analysis to reproductive rights, and they hadn’t made the data available.</p>

<p>So I went digging around the internet in search of a dataset of Supreme Court opinions text but had a surprisingly difficult time finding one. There were some datasets on how justices voted, data on lower and state courts, data on caselaw, and even a couple resources that had the text of oral arguments. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://scdb.wustl.edu/">Supreme Court Database</a> from Washington University Law</li>
  <li><a href="https://case.law/">Caselaw Access Project</a> from Harvard Law School</li>
  <li><a href="https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/supreme.html">Supreme Court Oral Arguments Corpus</a> from ConvoKit made by researchers at Cornell</li>
  <li><a href="https://free.law/projects/supreme-court-data">Supreme Court Data</a> from <a href="https://free.law/">Free Law Project</a> and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/">CourtListener</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But I couldn’t seem to find what I was looking for: a freely available dataset on Supreme Court opinions text in machine-readable format.</p>

<p>So I tried making it myself. <a href="https://github.com/nikhilgahlawat/scotus_scraper/tree/main">SCOTUS Scraper</a> is a project in-progreess that collects data from <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/">Justia</a>, <a href="https://www.oyez.org/">Oyez</a>, and the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/">US Supreme Court</a> and processes them into datasets that can be used for data science and research.</p>

<p>Some questions I’m hoping that can be asked of the data:</p>
<ul>
